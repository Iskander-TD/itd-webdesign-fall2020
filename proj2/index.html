    <p>24 HOURS IN CAIRO</p>
    <p>This website is designed to give you a tour of Cairo, Egypt. Hopefully, you will have
your interest piqued and decide to book a trip to this wonderful city full of
wonderful sights. Maybe this website will be so good that you completely ignore all
COVID-19 safety measures and travel internationally, throwing caution to the wind.
(I wrote this, it would be weird if this was from an actual travel site)
