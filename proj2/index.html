    <p>This website is designed to give you a tour of Cairo, Egypt. Hopefully, you will have your interest piqued and decide to book a trip to this wonderful city full of wonderful sights. Maybe this website will be so good that you completely ignore all COVID-19 safety measures and travel internationally, throwing caution to the wind. (I wrote this, it would be weird if this was from an actual travel site)</p>
